# AI Cover Letter Generator

This project is a web-based application that generates tailored cover letters by analysing a user’s resume alongside a specific job description. The goal is to streamline the job application process while ensuring each cover letter remains relevant, professional, and aligned with the role being applied for.

The application uses an AI language model to synthesise the provided information and produce a concise, role-specific cover letter suitable for submission to employers.

## How It Works

1. The user uploads their resume (typically as a PDF or text-based file).
2. The user pastes the job description for the role they are applying for.
3. The backend extracts relevant information from the resume and combines it with the job description.
4. An AI model generates a tailored cover letter based solely on the provided inputs.
5. The generated cover letter can be previewed and downloaded (e.g. as a PDF).

## Use of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence is used in this project to assist with **language generation and content structuring** only.

Specifically, the AI:
- Analyses the resume content supplied by the user
- Identifies key skills, experience, and qualifications
- Aligns this information with the requirements in the job description
- Produces a professionally written cover letter in clear, formal English

The AI **does not invent qualifications or experience**. All content in the generated cover letter is derived from the user’s resume and the job description they provide.

Final responsibility for reviewing, editing, and submitting the cover letter remains with the user.
